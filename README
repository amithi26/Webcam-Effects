# 🚀 **Interactive Grid Pixelation Effect Using OpenCV & Python**

## 📌 **Project Overview**
This project creates a dynamic grid effect overlay using a live webcam feed. The grid adapts to real-time GUI controls, allowing customization of cell size, circle radius, and RGB channels.

---

## ⭐ **Features**
- 🎥 **Real-Time Webcam Feed:** The effect processes live video input from the webcam.
- 🛠️ **Dynamic GUI Controls:** Adjust grid cell size, circle radius, and toggle fill status.
- 🎨 **Color Channel Control:** Enable/disable individual RGB channels.
- 📱 **Responsive Visuals:** Grid and circle size dynamically adapt to the selected parameters.

## 💻 **Technologies Used**
- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy**

## 🎮 **How to Use**
1. Run the script to start the webcam feed.
2. Use the GUI sliders to adjust:
   - **Cell Size:** Controls the grid cell dimensions.
   - **Circle Radius:** Automatically adjusts based on cell size.
   - **Fill Toggle:** Switch between filled and outlined circles.
   - **Color Channels:** Enable/disable RGB channels.
3. Press **Esc** to exit the program.

## 📚 **How It Works**
- The webcam feed is resized into a grid.
- Each grid cell is represented by a circle whose color matches the corresponding pixel.
- GUI sliders dynamically adjust grid size and visual appearance.
- Changes are reflected in real-time on the output window.
